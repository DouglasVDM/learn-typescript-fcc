var jello = "world"; //  Jello Type is "world" and Cannot be Changed because it's a Constant
var hello = "world"; //  Hello type is "String" because it's a Let, which can be Changed
hello = true; //  Cannot use Boolean because Type is String
hello = []; //  Cannot use Array because Type is String
var kello = "world"; //  Best Practice is to assign Type Explicitly
